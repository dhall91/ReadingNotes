Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
language itself, you need to become familiar with some key
concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in
three sections: 

A B C
What is a script and how do I
create one



I How do computers fit in with the 
world around them

How do I write a script for a
for web page


Scripts are made up of functions a computer can follow Step by step

Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps.
1: DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.
3: CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
As tempting as it can be to start coding straight
away, it pays to spend time designing your script
before you start writing it



EXPRESSIONS (Pages 74)

The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.


The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

reserved words in JavaScript. 

All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases. 


Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.


If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash). 




An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 



EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
given a value. As you have seen, this is done using
the assignment operator (the equals sign).
var color = 'beige';
The value of co 1 or is now beige.
When you first declare a variable using the var
keyword, it is given a special value of undefined.
This will change when you assign a value to it.
Technically, undefined is a data type like a number,
string, or Boolean. 



EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE
You can perform operations on any number of
individual values (see next page) to determine a
single value. For example:
var area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6.
Here the expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6. This
example also uses the assignment operator, so the
result of the expression 3 * 2 is stored in the variable
called area.
Another example where an expression uses two
values to yield a single value would be where two
strings are joined to create a single string.



ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige';
The value of co 1 or is now beige.
(See p61)
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6.
(See p76)
STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
The value of greeting is now Hi Molly. 



COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
buy = 3 > 5;
The value of buy is fa 1 se.
(See p150)
LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
The value of buy is now true.
(See p156)
